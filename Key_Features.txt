There is one missing value in the 'Customer Name' column.

Sales Trend Over Time
Insight:
Car sales data spans across multiple years, with certain peak periods where sales are significantly higher.
Monthly sales trends show that sales peak during certain months, likely due to seasonal promotions or year-end discounts.

Suggestion:
Identify the best-selling months and strategize discount offers and marketing campaigns during those periods.
Investigate the reason behind low sales months and introduce promotional campaigns to boost sales in those periods.

Sales Performance by Car Brands
Insight:
Certain brands like Ford, Chevrolet, and Toyota dominate the sales, while other brands have fewer sales.
Some luxury brands (e.g., BMW, Lexus, Cadillac) have lower sales volume but higher average selling prices.

Suggestion:
Dealerships should focus on stocking high-demand brands to maximize revenue.
For low-performing brands, investigate if pricing, marketing, or dealer location affects sales and make necessary adjustments.

Impact of Annual Income on Car Purchases
Insight:
Customers with higher annual incomes ($1,000,000 and above) tend to buy luxury cars, whereas middle-income customers opt for mid-range models.
A significant percentage of low-income customers purchase budget cars, indicating a demand for affordable vehicle financing options.

Suggestion:
Introduce customized financing options and EMI plans for different customer income groups.
Target high-income groups with premium models through personalized advertisements.

Transmission Preference
Insight:
Automatic transmission cars have higher sales compared to manual transmission models.
The preference for manual transmission cars is decreasing over time.

Suggestion:
Increase the stock of automatic transmission cars, as demand is shifting towards convenience.
Run marketing campaigns for manual transmission cars, targeting specific customer segments (e.g., driving enthusiasts, budget-conscious buyers).

Most Popular Car Colors
Insight:
The top-selling car colors are Black, Red, and White.
Less popular colors such as Pale White and unusual shades have lower sales volume.

Suggestion:
Dealers should stock more cars in popular colors to match customer preferences.
Introduce special discounts or promotions for less popular colors to boost sales.

Sales by Region
Insight:
Certain regions, such as Aurora, Greenville, and Middletown, contribute the most sales.
Some regions have low car sales despite having multiple dealerships.

Suggestion:
Focus on high-performing regions to maximize sales and open new dealerships in potential high-growth areas.
Conduct customer surveys in low-performing regions to understand and address the reasons for poor sales.

Body Style Preference
Insight:
SUVs and Sedans are the most popular body styles, whereas Hatchbacks and Hardtops have lower sales.

Offer special deals or financing options to increase the appeal of hatchbacks and hardtops.
